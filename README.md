# ECC_Hybrid_Encryption

## How ECC works in Encryption and Decryption:

ECC doesn’t directly encrypt or decrypt messages like symmetric encryption (e.g., AES), but it is used for key exchange and digital signatures. In practice, the encryption and decryption process using ECC follows these steps:

	1.	Key Generation: Each party generates a public and private key pair using ECC.
	•	The private key is a randomly selected integer.
	•	The public key is derived from the private key using an elliptic curve equation.
	2.	Encryption (via Hybrid Encryption):
ECC alone is not used to directly encrypt large amounts of data because it would be inefficient. Instead, it’s commonly used as part of a hybrid encryption scheme:
	•	A random symmetric key (e.g., AES key) is generated to encrypt the message.
	•	The symmetric key is then encrypted using ECC (with the recipient’s public key).
	•	The encrypted message and the encrypted symmetric key are sent to the recipient.
	3.	Decryption:
	•	The recipient uses their private ECC key to decrypt the symmetric key.
	•	The symmetric key is then used to decrypt the original message.

Comparison with RSA:

	•	ECC Advantages: ECC can offer the same level of security as RSA with much smaller keys (e.g., a 256-bit ECC key provides similar security to a 3072-bit RSA key). This results in faster computations, lower power consumption, and less storage or transmission bandwidth.
	•	RSA Advantages: RSA is more established, and there are more well-known implementations and libraries. However, its key sizes and computational cost are higher for the same security level compared to ECC.

## Conclusion:

You do not need to use RSA if you’re using ECC for encryption and decryption. ECC is sufficient on its own when used in a hybrid encryption scheme. If you’re looking for smaller key sizes and better efficiency, ECC is a good choice.
